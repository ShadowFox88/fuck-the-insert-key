# FUCK The Insert Key

Can't stand your cursor turning into a blinker? Hate it when you're going back to write something
and your code starts to get eaten up by your new blocky Pacman friend? Use Windows? Then boy do I
have the thing for you.

### Setup

1. Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com)
2. Download this repo as a ZIP
   ![It's right fucking there!](https://i.imgur.com/dfOeASu.png)
3. Run the `.AHK` file

Congrats, you kicked the Insert key out of it's own home. Good job! But we're not done yet.
Having to run this file every time you run Windows sucks, so let's make it work when your device
starts up.

4. Open a Run window (`Win+R`)
5. Go to the startup folder for your user - type `shell:startup` and hit Enter
6. Copy the `.AHK` file into the folder
7. Open Task Manager (`Ctrl+Shift+Esc``)
8. Make sure it starts up
   ![How the fuck do I do that? Well here's how!](https://i.imgur.com/htp49w5.png)

Now the Insert key _definitely_ has no home, and you made sure of that! Way to go, you fucking monster!

### Issues

**Run into any problems?** Make an issue on the repo.
**Setup doesn't work?** I'm not tech support but I'll see what I can do - no promises.
**Don't like me?** Go fuck yourself.

Still getting it.
